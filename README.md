# college

This is mbalc/college repo, where (almost) all code written during my IT 
bachelor's degree studies is located. 

Feel free to check out what kind of stuff I did experience throughout all these
years.

The code is organized in directories for each academic year and semester, and 
then for each subject I wrote any code for. Please visit a specific
directory and see `README` file for more details regarding this particular
section of my experience.
